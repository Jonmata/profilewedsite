                <h1>Here's a bit about me</h1>
                <p>Hi, my name is Jonathan Mata. I am a junior at the University at Buffalo and a graduate with an associates degree from Suffolk Community College, where I led two research projects focused on machine learning algorithms and the mathematics behind them. I am seeking a position that allows me to apply my programming, research, and problem-solving skills to help people and optimize the machines for companies, giving their consumers a satisfying experience for them. Over the past few years, I have been honing my knowledge of algorithms and data structures by tackling LeetCode challenges and working on programming projects in my free time.</p>
